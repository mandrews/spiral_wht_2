/**
\page measure_extension Adding a new Measure Extension to the Package

Presently the package can measure the execution of a \WHT Plan using PAPI and
the microsecond timer.  In the future, new libraries for measuring performance
may be necessary.

To add a new Measure Extension:
-# Develop a new extension by implementing the functions with the following
signatures: 
  - \ref measure_extension::init
  - \ref measure_extension::test
  - \ref measure_extension::call
  - \ref measure_extension::done
-# Register this into the \ref measure_extensions table using \ref
MEASURE_ENTRY.
