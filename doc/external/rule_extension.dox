/**
\page rule_extension Adding a new Breakdown Rule to the Package

There are various ways of recursively computing the \WHT
Breakdown rules describe how to perform computation of the plan.  

To add a new breakdown rule:
-# Develop a new breakdown %rule by first implementing a function with that
has the \ref rule_fp signature.  This function should verify that the %rule can be
applied to the node it is attached to in the plan.  The behavior of the %rule
can be parameterized during runtime using \ref rule::params.  
\see small_interleave_rule
\see split_interleave_rule
-# Add the breakdown %rule to registry.h, by declaring the function and then
utilizing either \ref SMALL_RULE_ENTRY or \ref SPLIT_RULE_ENTRY. 
-# List the source code that contains the %rule function in \ref wht_Makefile_am,
in the EXTENSION_FILES variable.  If there is any non compiled code such as a
header, list this in the EXTENSION_DISTS variable.
-# Compile time parameters should be controlled using the configure script \ref
configure_ac.  This in turn, defines macros in the \ref config_h file which can be
used to control compile time parameters.
