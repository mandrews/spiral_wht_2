TODO:

  - External interface 
    - Suffix for different types, e.g. whtf_parse
    - Suffix for value, e.g. whtf_value

  - C Version of best_trees store
    - Configure / CPUID info in header

  - C++ version of Dynamic Programming Search

  - Retooled version of Genetic Algorithm Search

  - More Perl test targets
    - Use wht_rand in conjunction with wht_classify

  - Doxygen man page generation

  - Utilize Doxygen \internal flag

  - Add PAPI instruction count interpolation to Instruction Count Model

  - Integrate these lists inside Doxgen comments

  - Count SSE should disassemble libwht.a not individual codelets

  - Flag to reset count SSE cache

  - Allow PAPI native events

	- Make nomenclature uniform, e.g.
		wht_attach -> wht_rule
		plan -> tree
		factors, degree, width -> ?
		leaf, size, node -> size

Bugs:

  - Some minor memory leak issues with parser.y
    - Need to patch file generated by bison

  - File parser.y should set wht_error when it cannot find a transform in the registry
    instead of displaying syntax error

  - Plans of the form split[split[ ... ] ] should be rejected by grammar

	- Does not install html manual to share ($htmldir)

  - Does not conditionally check headers xmmintrin.h, emmintrin.h

  - icc 10 papi.h fails with header sys/types.h caddr_t

  - should store extension info in a modular fashion

  - should not compile uncessary targets in .codelets (waste of time)

  - Fix SIMD WHT_FLOAT checks in generated code, should be #ifdef
