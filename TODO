Milestones:

  - External interface 
    - Suffix for different types

  - C Version of best_trees store
    - Configure / CPUID info in header

  - C++ version of DP

  - Retooled version of GA

  - Retool old versions of whtgen

  - Perl or C version of whtgen
    - Should accept sse and sse2 flags (shuf is platform specific)

  - More perl test targets

Bugs:

  - Some minor memory leak issues with parser.y
    - Need to free memory from temporary data structures using  
      bison %destructor directive

  - Dependancies not checked in maintainer mode (libtool, bison, flex, ruby)

  - Does not conditionally check headers xmmintrin.h, emmintrin.h, papi.h

  - share/wht_best_trees.txt should not be clobbered by new installation

  - dp should catch SIGINT and write best trees to disk

  - dp should check for write permssion on best tress

  - all tools should accept wht plan from stdin in addition to -w

  - Make large note about antilexographic storing of split children

Ideas:

  - look into pkg-config for versioning information
