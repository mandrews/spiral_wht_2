Milestones:

  - External interface 
    - Suffix for different types

  - Simple testing (make check) targets

  - Parser for weights input

  - C Version of DP

  - Retooled version of GA

  - Retool old versions of whtgen

  - Perl or C version of whtgen
    - Should accept sse and sse2 flags (shuf is platform specific)

  - C Version of best_trees store
    - Configure / CPUID info in header

Bugs:

  - Some minor memory leak issues with parser.y
    - Need to free memory from temporary data structures using  
      bison %destructor directive

  - Dependancies not checked (libtool, bison, flex, ruby)
    - Should be checked in maintainer mode only 

  - No detection of xmmintrin.h or __SSE2__ macro [ws77]
    - Should added -msse2 to CFLAGS in configure.ac

  - Codelet guards cannot handle validation of rightmost vectorized codelet

  - share/wht_best_trees.txt should not be clobbered by new installation

  - whtgen/whtgen should catch SIGINT and write best trees so to disk

  - FROM:
    - $ ../spiral_wht-2.0-pre-2/configure --with-papi=/usr/local/papi-3.2.1
       --prefix=$HOME/tmp/install --enable-interleave=3 --enable-sse2
       --enable-max-unroll=4

  X - $ ./bin/wht_measure -w 'split[smallv(2,16)[4], smallv(2)[4]]' -s 
      error, initialization guards should prevent this message

  X - $ ./bin/wht_measure -w 'split[smallil(4)[4], smallv(2)[4]]' -s 
      error, not configured for codelets of size 4 interleaved by 4

    - $ ./bin/wht_verify -w 'split[small[2], split[smallv(2,2)[2],small[2]], small[2]]'
      Segmentation fault

Issues:

  - Store left and right I sizes on W
    - Will remove need to call guard

  - Optional ''top-down'' validation of plan

  - splitil and internal stride issue

  - $ ./bin/wht_randtree -n 5
    error, not configured for unrolled codelets of size 5
