Milestones:

  - External interface 
    - Suffix for different types

  - C Version of best_trees store
    - Configure / CPUID info in header

  - C++ version of DP

  - Retooled version of GA

  - Retool old versions of whtgen

  - Perl or C version of whtgen
    - Should accept sse and sse2 flags (shuf is platform specific)

  - More perl test targets

Bugs:

  - Some minor memory leak issues with parser.y
    - Need to free memory from temporary data structures using  
      bison %destructor directive

  - Dependancies not checked in maintainer mode (libtool, bison, flex, ruby)

  - Does not conditionally check headers xmmintrin.h, emmintrin.h, papi.h

  - share/wht_best_trees.txt should not be clobbered by new installation

  - dp should catch SIGINT and write best trees to disk

  - dp should check for write permssion on best tress

  - all tools should accept wht plan from stdin in addition to -w

  - Make large note about antilexographic storing of split children

  - No conditional compilation check for PAPI

Ideas:

  - look into pkg-config for versioning information

Shortrun:
  - Run
    - Redo 5000 Samples @ 9,18 for Rightmost

  - DP
   - Flag for selecting rightmost subspace
   - Input for selecting possible transforms

  - Experiments
    - Best 1.8, SPIRAL, Normal 2-Children, My Best?

    - All
        Normal 2-Children, Vectorized 2-Children
        Normal 3-Children, Vectorized 3-Children
        ...

    - Only Rightmost
        Normal 2-Children, Vectorized 2-Children
        Normal 3-Children, Vectorized 3-Children
        ...

  - Analysis
    - Include PCA

  - Conversion utility input should just be something like:

      smallv(2,2,1)

    Parse this and let transform take care of rest.  Now registration for
    conversion is uncessary.

  - Also input to wht_dp should just be smallv(2,2,1), and lookup can be
    performed on string.

  Look into "Super" Extensions Idea
   - Modularized configure.ac
   - Script to add to registry
   - Special files for different registrys,
   - i.e. convert, ic count basis, etc ..
