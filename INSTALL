WHT Package Installation
==============================================================================


On UNIX systems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unpack the archive:

  tar -zxf spiral_wht-2.0.tar.gz SRC_DIR  

Optionally create a build directory so that the source directory doesn't get 
polluted with object files and tempories:

  mkdir BUILD_DIR; cd BUILD_DIR

Otherwise assume that SRC_DIR and BUILD_DIR are the same.
Next, choose from various optimzations listed by:

  ../SRC_DIR/configure --help

Once you have selected appropriate optimizations, configure with an
installation directory:

  ../SRC_DIR/configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR [OPTIONS]

Compile and install the package:
  make
  make install

Later on, you may want to uninstall the package:
  make uninstall

For using the programs and libraries installed by the package see the README
file.


On Windows systems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download the Cygwin environment and compile as above.
