WHT Package Installation
==============================================================================

This package is a modified version of the Spiral WHT 1.8 package:

  http://www.spiral.net/software/wht.html

It is presently a prelease, and some features and data structures will change
before the next release.

On UNIX systems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unpack the archive:

  tar -zxf spiral_wht-2.0.tar.gz SRC_DIR  

Optionally create a build directory so that the source directory doesn't get 
polluted with object files and temporaries:

  mkdir BUILD_DIR; cd BUILD_DIR

Otherwise assume that SRC_DIR and BUILD_DIR are the same.
Next, choose from various optimizations listed by:

  ../SRC_DIR/configure --help

Some noteworthy options are:

  Usage: ./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...

  Optional Features:
    --enable-double         compile with double precision floating point
                            (default is enabled)
    --enable-float          compile wht with single precision floating point
                            (default is disabled)
    --enable-max-unroll=N   maximum unrolled codelet size (default is 6)
    --enable-interleave=K   interleave K loop iterations in codelet (default
                            is disabled)
    --enable-sse            enable SSE optimizations (default is disabled)
    --enable-sse2           enable SSE2 optimizations (default is disabled)

  Optional Packages:
    --with-papi=PATH        compile with PAPI support, PATH is location of PAPI


Once you have selected appropriate optimizations, configure with an
installation directory:

  ../SRC_DIR/configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR [OPTIONS]

Compile and install the package:
  make
  make install

Later on, you may want to uninstall the package:
  make uninstall

For using the programs and libraries installed by the package see the README
file.


On Windows systems:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download the Cygwin environment and compile as above.
