Issues:
  - Tried streaming stores and fences -- seems to be intended for concurrent
    processing

  - Dynamic programming space
    - ZS1 algroithm for stream generation of integer compositions
    - For each integer in a composition, try best and possible transforms of the best

  - Addition of transpose, parallel split and genetic algorithm

  - Interface to package

  - Possible header and lib suffix for different types

  - Need "guards" to prevent segfault
    - Could check for membership in set of allowable codelets in position k
    - This set would help DP out

  - whtgen needs to be cleaned up

  - Parameterize which codelets to compile from configure

  - Parameterize which measure is used

  - support for ICC

For Maintainers:
  libtoolize
  autoreconf
  automake --add-missing
